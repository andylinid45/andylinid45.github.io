{% blockquote haml http://haml.info %}
Beautiful, DRY, well-indented, clear markup

You can see how haml selling himself to you at his website.  

But after using haml for sometime. I feel it sucks.  

There also many blog post telling you how suck haml does.  

But here, I want to get the point. It just because this technique is totally unnecessary.  

Building a web app is like playing lego toy bricks. No need to pick up all bricks in the worlk to make a great web app.  

Haml is just anohter beauty lie in the technical world.
